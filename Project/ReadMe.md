# General Notes:
All sections are labelled as "Task ...", not part, so when searching for a particular section be sure to use Task A/B/etc.
# OS:
MacOS Monterey / Big Sur was used during this project, there were no backwards compatibility issues between the two, we did however have different clang versions running on each of our separate laptops. This affected nothing when using the updated CMAKE file provided by Matthew in the CS/DS discord. 

# Setup:
All processes outlined in the project readme were followed for getting the project set up on mac, that is installing clang, cmake and x11. The project then built and compiled correctly, and we used command-line every time we wanted to build as we did not set up VS Code to build or run it.
